1. This a demonstration of a few features of animate.css originally authored by Daniel Eden.
2. Run the test.html in any browser for the demonstration.
3. Internet Connection is not necessary for demonstration but it'd still needed for the Google Fonts.
4. animate.js and jquery file is required. If not present then it won't work.
5. style.css is just for the styling purpose i.e animations would still work but the interface(front end) would be 
   less pleasant.
